# Play-Store-Review-Data-Analysis-wih-Python

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to uncover key factors that influence app engagement and success on the Google Play Store. Using Python, this project analyzes a dataset of Play Store apps and user reviews to provide valuable insights into app performance, user sentiment, and optimization strategies.  

## 📊 Abstract  
With thousands of new apps launching daily, developers face tough competition in the Play Store. Success is often measured through user ratings and reviews rather than direct revenue. However, ratings can be biased due to missing or insufficient votes. This project analyzes Play Store data using **Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn** to derive insights that help developers improve app performance.  

## 🎯 Problem Statement  
The Play Store dataset contains valuable information, including **app categories, ratings, reviews, installs, pricing, and user sentiments**. By exploring and analyzing this data, we aim to identify key factors that drive user engagement and app success.  

## 🏆 Business Objective  
- Analyze Play Store app data using Python.  
- Identify patterns in user ratings, reviews, and installs.  
- Provide insights for **app performance optimization** and **market strategy improvements**.  

## 📂 Datasets Overview  
### Play Store Dataset  
Contains **10,841 rows and 13 columns**, covering details such as:  
- **App Name, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Price, Content Rating, and Last Updated**.  

### User Reviews Dataset  
Contains **64,295 rows and 5 columns**, with attributes like:  
- **Translated Review, Sentiment (Positive/Negative/Neutral), Sentiment Polarity, and Sentiment Subjectivity**.  

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
- **Handled missing values**, removed duplicates, and converted data types.  
- **Transformed price, install count, and app size** into standardized formats.  
- **Visualized outliers** and removed anomalies for cleaner insights.  

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Key findings from EDA:  
- **92.3% of apps are free**, while only 7.7% are paid.  
- **Top genres**: Tools, Action, Photography, and Entertainment.  
- **Apps with higher ratings** tend to have **better sentiment polarity**.  
- **Revenue trends** show that **Lifestyle, Finance, and Weather** apps perform best.  
- **Smaller apps** (below 20MB) are preferred by users.  
- **Frequent updates improve user sentiment** over time.  

## 📈 Key Insights & Recommendations  
1. **Focus on popular genres** (Tools, Action, Entertainment).  
2. **Offer engaging free apps** with effective monetization models.  
3. **Optimize app size** to under 40MB to maximize downloads.  
4. **Target "Everyone" & "Teen" content ratings** for higher user reach.  
5. **Prioritize Android version compatibility** for better revenue potential.  
6. **Encourage positive sentiment** through feature updates & bug fixes.  
7. **Analyze negative reviews** to improve app quality.  
8. **Monitor user sentiment over time** and adapt updates accordingly.
